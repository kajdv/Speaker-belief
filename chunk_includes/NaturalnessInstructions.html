<font size="2" style="font-size: 13pt"><b>Before we begin, you'll need to familiarize yourself with two different kinds of naturalness.</b></font></p>
<br>
<p> Consider the following sentence:</p>
<br>
<div class="boxed"> <ol> 
<p class="oblique" >John isn't happy about the rumor that Natalie married the president of Sweden.</p>
</ol></div>
<br> 
<p> This sentence might seem weird for all sorts of reasons. For instance, Sweden doesn't have a president. Who are John and Natalie? And what is this rumor we're talking about, and why would John not be happy about it? Moreover, it seems like quite a strange thing for someone just to say!</p>
<br> 
<p> However, it's actually a perfectly well-formed sentence of English. If we imagine a better context, we can see that it actually sounds perfectly natural.</p> 
<br>
<div class="boxed"><ol>
<p> <tt> Suppose that that we live in a fictional or future world where Sweden is a republic. </tt></p>
<p > <tt>Natalie is a famous Swedish pop-singer, known for her many scandalous affairs.</tt></p>
<p > <tt>John is the president's advisor and PR-manager.</tt></p>
<br>  
<p class="oblique" >John isn't happy about the rumor that Natalie married the president of Sweden.</p>
</ol></div>
<br>   
<p> Much better, right? In this experiment, this sentence would be given a high score, close to <b>Completely natural</b>.</p> 
<br>
<p> Now compare this to the following, slightly modified version of the sentence, with the same context as above:</p> 
<br>
  <div class="boxed"><ol>
<p > <tt> Suppose that that we live in a fictional or future world where Sweden is a republic. </tt></p>
<p > <tt>Natalie is a famous Swedish pop-singer, known for her many scandalous affairs.</tt></p>
<p > <tt>John is the president's advisor and PR-manager.</tt></p>
<br>  
<p class="oblique" >John isn't doubting about the rumor that Natalie married the president of Sweden.</p>
</ol></div>
<br> 
<p> No matter how we might alter the context, this sentence is just not a well-formed, or natural sentence of English. This sentence would receive a low score, close to <b>Completely unnatural</b>. </p>
